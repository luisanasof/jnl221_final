    <p> <strong>When PEN America first offered her a job tracking cases of banned books across the country, Sabrina Baeta only expected to work for the organization’s pilot research project for three months. 
 </strong>  The organization, which <a href=https://pen.org/about-us/>promotes</a> freedom of expression through literature and human rights, was issuing an “informal response” to an observed movement happening in the country at that time, Baeta said.

  </p>

<p> That was in 2021. Today, Baeta continues to co-manage the organization’s databases of book bans or book ban attempts, which together currently list over 4,000 such challenges—the original dataset published after the end of the first semester of the 2021-22 school year listed 1,383 cases— from school districts across the United States in the last academic year and a half.   </p>

    <p> According to the aggregated data analyzed by The Ortiz Times, the majority of these cases are concentrated in only a handful of states; cases originating in the five largest challenge contributors—namely, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Missouri— accounted for over 80% of all cases. 
</p>

</script>
  </div>

    <p> But Baeta said it’s important to consider the influence of particular school districts on a state’s overall count. Pennsylvania’s Central York School District alone was responsible for nearly all of the state’s recorded cases, for instance; it saw 441 of the state’s 485 challenges.
</p>

    <p>
“(Depending on) the nature of the district, the makeup of the community will determine whether there are books that are likely to get pulled,” they said. 
 </p>

 <p>In some cases, libraries of certain school districts may never have offered certain titles or content to begin with. </p> 

<p>“If a library doesn’t have all that diverse (of) literature, it’s going to seem like there’s no book bannings happening there, but it’s because there’s nothing to pull,” Baeta said.</p>  

<p>As for states that lack reported book bans or ban attempts, Baeta said it’s doubtful certain states have not experienced a book ban. Representation of states in the database largely depends on the “transparency” of their school districts, or whether the media reported on these cases, she said.</p>

<iframe title="Book Ban Types by State" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-Re4WA" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Re4WA/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="342" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>  </div>
 
<p>So who, or what, exactly, brings about these challenges in such large numbers? Baeta said the multitude of factors at play makes it difficult to pinpoint, but a large part of it has to do with the pressure advocacy groups place on school districts to remove certain titles, especially when different groups coordinate to do so. At times, the influence from such organizations may cross state lines. </p>

<p>“(There’s) this level of fear and intimidation, and school districts trying to do what's best by their teachers and their students are being put in really tough positions and having to self-censor,” she said. “It’s a fine line. There's no blame to be placed on the district, but at the same time, sometimes they are the ones causing the removal.”</p>

<div class="story-copy">

  <p>For organizations, having a strong digital presence is essential to garnering this support, said Jasmina Tacheva, an assistant professor in Syracuse University’s School of Information Studies. In today’s increasingly polarized political and digital climate, Tacheva said social media can act as “echo chambers” where progressive and conservative-leaning users tend to follow and surround themselves with other users sharing their beliefs. </p>

<p>Yet interactions are not limited to digital, or even local, spaces. Oftentimes, internet activity stimulates and translates into “offline” political action. </p>

<p>“Because of the internet, it’s not just a mom being upset about her particular child,” Tacheva said. “Behind this mom, there might be a community—not necessarily her neighborhood community, I mean her digital neighborhood community.”</p>

<p>The instantaneous nature of such exchanges is thus ideal for like-minded advocates from different regions to organize at a national level, Baeta added. She referenced anecdotal cases of supporters traveling to advocate in districts they otherwise had no ties to.</p>

<p>Tacheva, who had recently returned from a trip to Austin, Texas, recalled witnessing the beginning of the “How Many More?” rally at the Texas State Capitol, where she noticed multiple buses bringing in protesters. </p>

<p>“Usually what happens in (online community spaces)  is, if there's an organized event, then people that are part of that community are invited to take part in it,” she said. “It was clear to me that these people were not native to Austin, Texas, necessarily, but that they had organized to be bussed in and attend that event.” </p>   

<p>Though Baeta said the scope of PEN America’s research has shifted as it has gone on, it remains clear that bans remain “targeted” towards marginalized communities, who Tacheva said are the “passive victims” of the movement. </p>

<p>For this reason, she added, it’s important to highlight those working to counter bans when they believe these communities are at a disadvantage without access to certain titles. </p>

<p>“For every action to ban a book, there's a counter action,” she said. “There’s very courageous librarians and school teachers that are literally risking their lives, making sure this kind of information is not closed off for their communities, for their students, and bearing the brunt of this fight.”</p>
